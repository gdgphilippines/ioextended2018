  "bio": "Jecelyn speaks English, Mandarin, C#, Typescript, JavaScript and Angular. Web development ninja by nature, Software architect by profession, she is also a Google Developer Expert (GDE) in Angular & director of Women Who Code KL. She funnels her passion in tech into publishing articles as well as sharing her knowledge via workshops and conferences and meet-ups. Ironically her favourite past time away from work involves travelling to remote islands without WiFi for deep sea diving expeditions and reading books with tangible covers."
